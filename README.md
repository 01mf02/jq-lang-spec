# A formal specification of the jq language

This is an ongoing effort to create
a formal specification of the programming language provided by [`jq`].

Run `typst compile spec.typ` to generate a PDF version of the specification.
For this, Typst 0.10 should be installed.

[`jq`]: https://jqlang.github.io/jq/
