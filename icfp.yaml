abstract: >
  `jq` is a widely used tool that provides a programming language to manipulate JSON data.
  However, the jq language is currently only specified by its implementation,
  making it difficult to reason about its behaviour.
  To this end, we provide a formal syntax and denotational semantics for
  a large subset of the jq language.
  In particular, we give a translation from jq programs to lambda terms.
  Our most significant contribution is to provide a new way to interpret updates
  that allows for more performant execution.
  We implement our semantics in two interpreters and evaluate the performance.
